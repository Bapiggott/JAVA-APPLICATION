**Description of our app:**

In this repository, we define the graphical user interface (GUI) of a mobile phone homescreen application coded in Java that can be launched on any laptop/computer using an IDE. The purpose of this code is to create a homescreen interface that displays a grid of icons representing various applications installed on a smartphone. Users can click on these icons to launch the corresponding applications. We have a few apps including a scientific calculcator; a graphing calculator; an app for YouTube; an app for painting on a white canvas in the form of Pixel art and a music app that opens up windows for playing the paino, guitar or drums.

The purpose of building an app that represents a smartphone screen with built-in apps is to create a realistic simulation of a smartphone interface that users can interact with. This type of app is commonly used for demonstration, education, or testing purposes. For demonstration purposes, the app can be used to showcase the features and functionality of a particular smartphone model or operating system. This can be useful for sales representatives or product demonstrations where users may not have access to the physical device. For educational purposes, the app can be used to teach users how to use various features and functions of a smartphone, such as navigating the home screen, opening and closing apps, and adjusting settings. For testing purposes, the app can be used to test the compatibility and functionality of other mobile apps. For example, developers may use this type of app to test how their app functions on different smartphone models and operating systems. Overall, the purpose of building an app that represents a smartphone screen with built-in apps is to create a convenient and easy-to-use tool for demonstrating, teaching, and testing smartphone functionality.

We plan on collaborating with each other and honing in our efforts together for establishing the homescreen of a modern-day smartphone and building apps on it. Currently, we have multiple different apps and we are expanding our base and connecting all of them together. We are open to collaborate with other creators if they want to join us in our project. We will be working on the various different applications within this "mega app" and integrating them together for as much of a seamless flow as possible.
